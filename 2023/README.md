To expand my horizons, I'm trying to solve the [AdventOfCode 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles with F#. 

## Day 1: Trebuchet?! ‚≠ê

I'd spent a little time yesterday trying to prepare the workspace, but today's first task shows that I'm _really_ not used to the F# syntax. I wrote something I thought would work, but got nowhere at the start of the day. It was only later that I struggled more and started to get a grasp on how the language behaves. The compiler messages still feel really rough, and remind me of when I was first learning to program.
